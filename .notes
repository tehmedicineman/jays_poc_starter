Thoughts/Questions
	"Approval Workflow" is attached to the "Data Object"?
		Could possible Super an Approval Workflow to a "Data Domain", which is overwritable... actually i kinda like that Idea
		These workflows could be re-usable... aka you don't assign each part of the workflow to each object/domain, but instead assign a "Workflow" to the object/domain
	Do we just want this to plug off emails with links?

Workflow
	:Request
		Submitted By Requestor
		Sent to first "Approver"
		Sent to next "Approver"
		etc... marked as "Approved" when done through the workflow
		Sent to "Data Warehouse Staff"
		Marked as "Completed"

	Requestor
		Submitting a Request
			Login
			Fill out form
				Â¿Accessor Account?
					I assume this process will want to be used for not just personal accounts so this would make sense to add as well
				Data Domain
				Data Object
				Access Type (CRUD)
				Reason for Access
			Wait For Approval
				Maybe back/forth with Datawarehouse Staff for account in and/or approvers for clarification, but this would be communication not functionality
			View Approval response
				probably includes anything about accounts to gain access

	Supervisor / Data Stewards / Additional Approvers
		Finding Requests
			Login
			View a page with requests
				assume we will want to be able to specifically view open/closed requests, maybe various filtering so-on-so-forth.
		Approving Request
			Login
			Find/Navigate to request.
			Mark approval
				Can also fill in "Reason Statement" here... comments O.o
